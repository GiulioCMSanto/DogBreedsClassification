## Dog Breeds Classification
---

This project was carried out as a requirement of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.
The main idea of the project is to build an application that is able to classify the dog breed
of a given dog image and identify if the image is a Human instead of a doga.

The project explores Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning.
